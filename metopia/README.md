# 🌌 METOPIA — The City Where UI Lives

Metopia is not just a frontend website.  
It’s a **visual experience** — a digital skyline carved with motion, glow, and precision.

Built with modern frontend weapons like **React, Framer Motion, GSAP, and advanced CSS**, Metopia pushes pixels beyond boredom and into cinematic territory. Every animation has intent. Every section breathes. Every interaction says: “This is not a template.”
